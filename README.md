# GoogleStockPrediction
this is my implementation in TensorFlow, to predict google stock for 2016-2021. I used a GRU model to predict "open" price and an LSTM model for "close" price.  

after model training, I used them to go further and predict the next 30 days, you can see that the prediction follows the real trend which is a success in this case:)
